# Composable POMP Models

This is a Scala library for inference and filtering of state space models with a continuous time latent state. The library relies on Akka Streams.

For library documentation, see the [guide](https://jonnylaw.github.io/ComposableStateSpaceModels) or the paper,

## Quick Start

### Using a build.sbt File

This release version of this library is built for Scala 2.12.1, add the following dependency to your `build.sbt` file in the project root.

```scala
libraryDependencies += "com.github.jonnylaw" %% "composablemodels" % "0.6.5"
```

### Interactive Installation

If you want to play around with the library interactively, then run sbt and enter the following commands:

```bash
$ sbt
> set scalaVersion := "2.12.1"
> set libraryDependencies += "com.github.jonnylaw" %% "composablemodels" % "0.6.5"
> console
```
